This is the python script that, with py2exe, can create an executable file.

This exe file will run the script that I explained in my thread,
but without the need to install python or know how to run a script.

The hardest part might be pasting into the command window, but there's an explanation to that in the program itself.

###To compile the exe file
You will need `py2exe` installed and use setup.py with `python setup.py` and a standalone executable will be created.
